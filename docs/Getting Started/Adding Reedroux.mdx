## Authorization

---

### Step 1

Once you've decided to use the best **companion** on Discord, then you can continue to invite it to your favorite server!

<Image img={require('../../static/img/docs/adding/oauth.png')} width="90%" height="90%" />

Tap or click the `Select a server` button. A pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Reedroux.

### Step two

Once you've selected the server that you'd like to add Reedroux to, you can press the `Continue` button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

<Image img={require('../../static/img/docs/adding/oauth-deux.png')} width="90%" height="90%" />

:::caution Note
If you want to disable `Administrator` permission from Reedroux, it will not work properly! You will still be able to listen to basic music features but some things won't work.

### Final Step

Once you press the `Authorize` button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected to our thank-you page. In addition, you'll also see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Spectacular!**

Now let's get the party started by [playing some songs](/play-song)!
