- **Ws cluster (sharding)**
- **Some anime commands**

### Why the Change from CommonJS to ESM?
The transition was made because it is believed that ECMAScript Modules (ESM) are the future of JavaScript, especially when integrating with other engines.

### Why the Change from Javascript to Typescript?
To address and minimize random API errors in production, the shift to Typescript has been made to ensure better stability and reliability.

### Current Status of Reedroux's:
Updates for the current version will continue until 1/1/2028. After this date, support for the current version will end, and it will be archived.

## TL;DR
Reedroux will continue to undergo rewrites in Typescript to improve performance and stability.
